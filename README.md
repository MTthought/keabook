# Keabook
This project is a Facebook-like interface where users can upload and post content and can see other peopleâ€™s activity. The idea was to make a Facebook for KEA students, so that is why the name is Keabook. It was built for the KEA Web Security module, which is a Web Development module that aims at instructing students on how to protect web applications against attacks and took place on the second semester. 

The web application implements the web security learnt throughout the course and it does not use any framework. All protection has therefore been built using PHP, JavaScript and an SQL database.
The web application is a solo project with simple functionality that adds to an old project started for the Database subject on first semester. It is protected against the simplest attacks as set by the Web Security subject.
